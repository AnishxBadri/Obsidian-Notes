- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE SQL` command to help figure out what query is actually doing and find way s to improve.
- If you see `FULL SCAN`, then it is bad for performance.
- Use indexing to improve row scan commands. When the databases are executing a query, it uses the relevant index like a pointer, enabling it to read only the relevant rows of data to find the information you are searching, instead of having to read the entire table.
- Don't query more than you need.
- Avoid `SELECT DISTINCT`, use `WHERE` instead.
- `INNER JOIN` Wherever possible. OUTER JOINS are the least efficient.
- KEEP subqueries small
- Use `UNION ALL` vs `UNION` wherever possible.
- Store the smallest amount of information you can while still meeting your needs.
- A good index will:
- Filter the data efficiently.
- Eliminate the need to sort the data.
- Answer your query with data found in the index.
